# Rigid Body Dynamics for a 6-link Robotic Arm

A from-scratch implementation of direct multi-body dynamics for a six link robotic arm.

This research was carried out as part of a collaboration between the Department of Physics, Electrical Engineering, and Medicine at the University of Calgary. During the preliminary design phase of [Project Neuroarm](http://www.neuroarm.org/project/)---a research effort aiming to put a tele-operated robotic arm on the ISS---it was important to understand how graviational differences affect how the arm (the [JACO2 6-DoF from Kinova](https://www.kinovarobotics.com/product/gen2-robots)) responds to actuator inputs.
